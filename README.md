# Sticky_Notes_Application
This program was my lengthiest project in which I attempted to make a usable application bundled together with PyInstaller for any user to note down daily reminders. This includes the ability to open a sticky note that can be left open or closed on your desktop, along with saving and opening capabilities. Furthermore, some easy to click buttons with links to frequently visited university websites and a calender to make the program more helpful.

Within this project, I learnt how to use QT Designer efficiently, split up 1000+ lines of code to create more manageable files and create various functions such as saving and opening files using QFileDialog along with linking these functions to various buttons. I further understood how classes worked through creating a constructer and referencing other classes.

Thanks for checking out the project and hope you are doing well!
